# Game Vision

## Elevator Pitch

StarTrader is a 2D multiplayer space trading game where players fly ships between planets, buy/sell goods for profit, and defend cargo from pirates or hostile players.

## Core Fantasy

- Be a trader captain in a living star system.
- Take economic risks for profit.
- Survive dangerous approach zones and ambushes.
- Upgrade ship and reputation over time.

## Design Pillars

1. **Meaningful Trade Decisions**
   - Different planets specialize in different goods.
   - Prices vary over time and by location.

2. **Risk by Space Zone**
   - Flight is fully free between all planets/stations.
   - Safety and profit vary by where you choose to travel and approach.

3. **Realtime Piloting and Combat**
   - Flight and combat are skill-based in 2D realtime.
   - Positioning and ship loadout matter.

4. **Persistent Multiplayer World**
   - Shared market pressures and player interactions.
   - PvE (pirates) and optional PvP conflict.

## Initial Constraints

- Web-based client.
- Python backend.
- Single star system (solar-system-like scale).
- 2D simulation and rendering.
